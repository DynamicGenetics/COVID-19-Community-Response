The borgLayers are dynamically generated so we can change: 
category names, 
layer names, 
enable or disable layers, 
layer colors, 
layer categories, 
shown layers by default,
and in theory layer resolution, 
we just need to change these properties in the dataSources.py (either the dataSources or colorLayers dictionaries respective to the change you want to make)
