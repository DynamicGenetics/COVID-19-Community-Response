# Covid Community Map Project 

This is a project to map community support in Wales throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We are using a range of open and government data sources to understand the population distributions that may be signigicant when planning community support, and displaying this alongside known existing sources of community support. We are also developing a series of layers that can help the viewer to account for potential bias in the data when viewing the map.  

The project is a collaboration between the Dynamic Genetics group and Public Health Wales.

### Environment Setup

Instructions to setup the (local) Python development stack are reported here: 
[setup.md](./setup.md)

#### Code formatting

If possible, use the [black code formatter](https://github.com/python/black) (e.g.
`pip install black`) and run it before submitting your code to the repository. 
This helps maintain consistency.

Formatting is as simple as running:

```bash
black .
```

in the root of the project.
