#### Code formatting

If possible, use the [black code formatter](https://github.com/python/black) (e.g.
`pip install black`) and run it before submitting your code to the repository. 
This helps maintain consistency.

Formatting is as simple as running:

```bash
black .
```

in the root of the project.
