# Covid Community Map Project

This is a project to map community support in Wales throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are using a range of open and government data sources to understand the population
distributions that may be signigicant when planning community support,
and displaying this alongside known existing sources of community support.

We are also developing a series of _layers_ that can help the viewer to account for
potential bias in the data when viewing the map.

The project is a collaboration between the [Dynamic Genetics](http://dynamicgenetics.org) 
group and [Public Health Wales](https://phw.nhs.wales).
